# Peer Review
## David Fainstein Reviewing Group 2: Sarah, Wanjia, Meg, Lea

This is an exceptionally well put together draft. As I was traversing your code, I didn't have much to add on top of what you've already put together. Your code writing is clear and your supporting explanations are perhaps even better. It was tough to conduct a review that provide added benefit because, well, I don't really even know where to start with improvements. Celebrate your success with this draft, and take a look below for a few ideas that struck me:

## Strengths
1. You have incorporated features of the assignment into a coherent, usable blog post series. 
2. Your interlacing of code with text and supporting information/figures is strong. I learned a ton that reinforced my knowledge from reading your content
3. I think that the open-source nature of starting with real-world, accessible data that you clean and then run through the assignment components is so impressive!
